"""Consulting24 / Crypto License Panama — daily Blogger content pipeline.

Posts AI-written, long-form SEO articles about crypto licensing to a Blogger
blog owned by mardo@consulting24.co, each linking back to consulting24.co
landing pages.

This is a SEPARATE project from boat-rental-marbella. It reuses the same
Google OAuth *desktop client* (the client_secret JSON is account-agnostic),
but authorises as mardo@consulting24.co and stores its own token at
  ~/.consulting24_blogger_token.json
so the two projects never share Blogger credentials.

State:  config/blog_posted.json   (keyed by article slug — each posted once)
Topics: ARTICLES list below (authored long-form content, text-only)

Setup:
  GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/client_secret_desktop.json   (in .env)
  BLOGGER_BLOG_ID=<consulting24 blog id>                    (in .env)

<h2>Crypto Licensing in {YEAR}: The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>Choosing where to license a crypto business in {YEAR} is no longer a simple cost calculation.
The regulatory map has hardened considerably over the last three years. In the European Union, the
Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) has replaced the patchwork of national VASP registers
with a single Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) authorisation that passports across all 27 member
states. That passport is powerful &mdash; but it comes with capital requirements, governance
obligations and a multi-month authorisation process that smaller projects often underestimate.</p>
<p>Outside the EU, the picture is more varied. Offshore and territorial-tax jurisdictions compete on
speed, cost and privacy, while major financial centres such as Switzerland, the UAE and Singapore
compete on credibility and institutional access. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sits over all
of them: its &ldquo;travel rule&rdquo; and AML standards now apply, in some form, almost everywhere a
serious crypto business would consider basing itself. Jurisdictions that ignore FATF expectations end
up grey-listed, which quietly closes correspondent-banking doors for every company registered there.</p>
<p>This is why the question behind <strong>{kw}</strong> is rarely &ldquo;which licence is cheapest?&rdquo;
It is &ldquo;which regime matches my customers, my risk appetite and my banking needs?&rdquo; An EU-retail
exchange and an offshore OTC desk serving high-net-worth clients in Latin America have almost nothing in
common in terms of the right base. Getting this decision right at the start saves you from the single most
expensive mistake in the industry: licensing in the wrong place and having to re-domicile a live business.</p>
<p>Consulting24 has guided more than 200 crypto company setups across 15+ jurisdictions since 2017, which
means we have seen how each of these regimes behaves in practice rather than just on paper. The summary
below is the same framework we use with clients &mdash; and we are always happy to map it to your specific
model. Start with our <a href="{SITE}/vs-lithuania/">Panama vs Lithuania comparison</a> to see how the
trade-offs play out between an offshore base and an EU-passported one.</p>

    return f"""
<h2>Banking and Compliance: Where Most Setups Actually Stall</h2>
<p>Incorporation is the easy part of any crypto project. Banking is where timelines slip and where
under-prepared founders lose months. Since 2023, banks and payment processors worldwide have tightened
their onboarding of crypto-adjacent businesses, and they now expect a genuinely professional application
&mdash; not a one-page business summary. A thin file is simply rejected, and re-applying with the same bank
is far harder than getting it right the first time.</p>
<p>Three documents do the heavy lifting. The first is a written <strong>AML/KYC compliance program</strong>:
your customer-onboarding flow, transaction-monitoring rules, sanctions and PEP screening, a named compliance
officer, and record-keeping policies. The second is a clear, evidenced <strong>source-of-funds</strong> file
for both the company and its beneficial owners. The third is a coherent <strong>business description</strong>
that explains who your customers are, how money moves, and what volumes you project. Banks approve businesses
they understand; ambiguity reads as risk.</p>
<p>Sequencing matters as much as substance. The correct order is: incorporate the operating entity, build the
compliance program, assemble the source-of-funds package, and only then approach banking &mdash; ideally
through a warm introduction rather than a cold application. Founders who approach banks mid-setup, before
their file is complete, create the very delays they are trying to avoid. We make direct introductions to
banks and crypto-friendly payment rails as part of every engagement, but the introduction only works if the
file behind it is ready.</p>
<p>None of this is optional, and none of it changes much from one jurisdiction to the next &mdash; the
compliance bar is now broadly global. What changes is the appetite of local banks and the speed of
onboarding. Our <a href="{SITE}/requirements/">requirements checklist</a> sets out exactly what you need to
assemble before you approach a bank.</p>
"""

def _evergreen_choosing(topic: dict) -> str:
    return f"""
<h2>How to Choose the Right Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>Work the decision in this order &mdash; customers first, everything else second:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Who are your customers?</strong> EU retail means you need a MiCA passport (Lithuania, Malta or
  another EU CASP). US customers mean state-by-state money-transmitter licensing or a FinCEN MSB &mdash; consider
  a Canada MSB or a US setup. Latin America, Asia or HNW clients mean an offshore or territorial base such as
  Panama is usually the better fit.</li>
  <li><strong>Do you need a regulator badge?</strong> A public-facing exchange chasing institutional partners
  and fundraising often needs the reputational lift of an EU, Swiss or VARA licence. An OTC desk or token
  treasury usually does not.</li>
  <li><strong>What is your budget and timeline?</strong> Offshore and territorial routes set up in weeks for
  tens of thousands; premium onshore licences take many months and six figures.</li>
  <li><strong>What about tax?</strong> Territorial-tax jurisdictions like Panama charge 0% on foreign-source
  income; EU jurisdictions apply standard corporate tax. Factor total cost of ownership, not just setup fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many offshore-first founders, Panama lands at the intersection of fast incorporation, low cost and 0%
tax on foreign-source income, which is why it features so heavily in our work. But the honest answer is that
the &ldquo;best&rdquo; jurisdiction is the one that matches the four answers above &mdash; and that is a
conversation worth having before you spend a cent. See our <a href="{SITE}/cost/">cost breakdown</a> and
<a href="{SITE}/application-process/">application process</a> to ground the decision in real numbers.</p>
"""

def _evergreen_mistakes(topic: dict) -> str:
    kw = topic["keyword"]
    return f"""
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>The failures we see when founders research <strong>{kw}</strong> on their own are remarkably
consistent, and almost all of them are avoidable. The first is <em>licensing to the headline tax rate</em>.
A 0% jurisdiction is worthless if your customers legally require a regulated provider you cannot become
there &mdash; you will simply have to start again. Decide who you are allowed to serve first, then optimise
for tax.</p>
<p>The second is <em>treating the compliance program as paperwork</em>. The AML/KYC program is not a
formality to satisfy a regulator; it is the document your bank reads most closely. A generic template
downloaded from the internet is transparent to any compliance officer and will sink your banking
application. It needs to reflect your actual product, customer base and risk profile.</p>
<p>The third is <em>underestimating banking lead time</em>. Founders routinely budget for incorporation and
forget that the bank account &mdash; the thing that actually lets the business operate &mdash; can take longer
than the licence itself. Build banking into your launch timeline from day one, not as an afterthought.</p>
<p>The fourth is <em>ignoring personal tax residency</em>. A company in a low-tax jurisdiction does not erase
your obligations where you personally live. Many founders create unexpected liabilities by structuring the
company perfectly and ignoring themselves. We introduce qualified tax advisors precisely to close this gap.</p>
<p>The fifth and most expensive is <em>choosing a provider on price alone</em>. The cheapest setup that
results in a rejected bank application or a re-domiciliation is far more expensive than doing it properly
once. Ask any provider to itemise their fee and explain their banking track record before you commit.</p>
"""

def _evergreen_aftercare(topic: dict) -> str:
    return f"""
<h2>What Happens After You Are Licensed</h2>
<p>Getting licensed and banked is the start, not the finish. Every regulated or registered crypto business
carries ongoing obligations, and letting them lapse is how companies lose their standing &mdash; and their
banking. At minimum you will maintain a registered agent or local presence, file annual renewals or
supervision fees, keep accounting records, and keep your compliance program live with periodic reviews and
updated sanctions and PEP screening lists.</p>
<p>Most jurisdictions also expect you to keep your beneficial-ownership information current and to report
material changes &mdash; new directors, new shareholders, a pivot in business activity &mdash; promptly.
Transaction monitoring is not a one-time setup either; screening rules need tuning as your volumes and
customer mix evolve. Banks may request periodic refreshes of your KYC and source-of-funds documentation,
particularly after a year of trading or a significant change in activity.</p>
<p>This is why we offer ongoing maintenance on an annual retainer rather than treating setup as a one-off
transaction. The cost of staying compliant is a fraction of the cost of losing a banking relationship and
having to rebuild one from scratch. Plan for it in your year-two budget from the outset, and treat your
compliance function as a living part of the business rather than a box you ticked at launch.</p>
<p>It is also worth planning ahead for growth. A structure that suits a pre-revenue startup may not suit
the same company once it is processing meaningful volume, adding new product lines, or expanding into new
markets. Many of the businesses we work with begin in a fast, low-cost offshore base to validate the model,
then add a second regulated entity &mdash; an EU CASP, for example &mdash; once revenue justifies the cost
and the market access genuinely matters. Designing the first structure with that possible second step in
mind keeps your options open and avoids a disruptive re-domiciliation later. We map this growth path out
with clients during the initial planning stage so the early decisions support, rather than constrain, where
the business is heading.</p>
